## What This Project Delivers

- Processes 62,000+ records through Bronze, Silver, and Gold data layers
- Trains and evaluates 3 core ML models for insurance decision support
- Produces batch predictions for churn risk, fraud risk, and high-cost claims
- Tracks quality and performance with repeatable, documented workflows

### Core Business Outcomes

1. Policy churn prediction for proactive retention
2. Claim fraud detection for investigation prioritization
3. High-cost claim prediction for early intervention

---

## Architecture At A Glance

1. Bronze layer: raw ingestion and schema-preserving storage
2. Silver layer: cleansing, validation, standardization, and feature-ready transforms
3. Gold layer: facts, dimensions, marts, star schemas, and ML-ready datasets
4. ML layer: training, evaluation, versioned artifacts, and scoring outputs
