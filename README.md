| `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` → "Getting Started" section | Step-by-step setup | 5 min |
| `DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md` | GCP deployment & release schedule | 8 min |
| `_03_Gold/Gold_layer_documentation.md` | Gold-layer outputs and analytics context | 8 min |

### 🔍 Deep Dives

| Topic | Document | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Production Monitoring** | `Project_Documentation/Phase_4_Documentation/README_PRODUCTION.md` | Real-time ML monitoring, alerts, SLAs |
| **ML Model Details** | `Project_Documentation/ML_TESTS_SUMMARY/ML_TESTS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | Model specs, performance, features |
| **Gold Data Layer** | `_03_Gold/Gold_layer_documentation.md` | Gold marts, dimensions, and fact tables |

## ⚡ Quick Access

### Most Common Tasks

| Task | File | Command |
|------|------|---------|
| Run full pipeline | `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` → Getting Started | `python Master_Run_Pipeline.py` |
| Check model performance | `ML_TESTS_SUMMARY/ML_TESTS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | Review metrics |
| Deploy to GCP | `DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md` → Implementation | See deployment guide |
| Run tests | `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` → Testing section | `pytest tests/` |

### Docker Quick Start

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t bupa-insurance-ml .

# Run the pipeline in a container
docker run --rm bupa-insurance-ml
```

Use Docker when you want a reproducible, isolated environment for pipeline execution.

### Key Metrics at a Glance

- ✅ **Data Volume**: 62,000+ records processed
- ✅ **Pipeline Speed**: ~15 minutes end-to-end
- ✅ **Data Quality**: 98.3/100 score
- ✅ **Model Performance**: AUC 0.856-0.912
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 127 tests (100% pass rate)
- ✅ **Production Ready**: 9.5/10 enterprise score

## 🎓 Document Purposes (NOT Duplicated)

### Why Each Document Exists

1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Comprehensive guide (all aspects in one place)
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical design, data models, system interactions
3. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Speed lookup, decision trees, checklists
4. **Phase_4_Documentation** - Production operations & real-time monitoring
5. **ML_TESTS_SUMMARY** - Model specifications & training details
6. **DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md** - Cloud deployment & release timeline
7. **Gold_layer_documentation.md** - Curated gold-layer documentation

**Eliminated:**
- ❌ 40+ timestamped run reports (execution logs, not docs)
- ❌ Redundant status reports (MAIN_BRANCH, FEATURE_BRANCH folders)
- ❌ Duplicate test summaries (consolidated to one)
- ❌ Overlapping audit reports (kept authoritative versions)

---

## 🔧 Documentation Maintenance

### Guidelines

- **Each document has ONE purpose** - no duplication
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** is the master reference
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** enables fast lookups
- **Specialized docs** (ARCHITECTURE, Phase_4) dig deeper into specific topics
- **All docs link to each other** for navigation

### Before Adding New Docs

Ask: "Does this already exist in PROJECT_OVERVIEW or QUICK_REFERENCE?"
- If **YES** → Add a link, don't duplicate
- If **NO** → Create it with a specific, non-overlapping purpose

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **New to the project?** → Read [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](./Project_Documentation/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
2. **Need quick info?** → Check [`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
3. **Deploying to GCP?** → Follow [`DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md`](./DEPLOYMENT_ROADMAP.md)
4. **Production operations?** → See [`Phase_4_Documentation`](./Project_Documentation/Phase_4_Documentation/)
5. **Gold data model details?** → Review [`Gold_layer_documentation.md`](./_03_Gold/Gold_layer_documentation.md)
